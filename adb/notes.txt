I at least got everything converted over to the place where you can run ./main/main.go
and it grows and writes to disk properly. I havent tested anything else other than that.
So far, the chages I have made have touched: db.go, store.go, bpt.go (and of course notes.txt
as well as main/main.go); hopefully this is enought info to troubleshoot anything that you may
be facing. Just have a look at ./main/main.go if you have any questions, it should illuminate
any possible questions you may have, unless I totally forgot about something (which is totally
possible; lets be real.)

Side note: i just texted Gabe about 15 min ago, and he said he's planning on being in here this
Thursday. Just wanted to relay that in case you haven't hear from him. Thanks Greg, you're a life-
saver, but not the the candy type of way... like in the flotation device type of way.
