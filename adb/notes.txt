+ added Match() method which simply finds and returns
  all documents containing the matched string provided

TODO: 
----------------------
- pack "store.dat" and "store.idx" into "db/store/dat"
  and "db/store/idx" folders to for better organization

- implement a fuzzy string creator (regex) and couple
  with the Match() method for a better "query engine"
